# More XFood
This mod adds a few foods which use different ways of creating them. It's basically for learning modding because it's the first mod I ever made. 
Now, it's a mod which adds random food, mainly the favorite food of my girlfriend: chicken fricassee. Why? Because I made it as a present for her.
