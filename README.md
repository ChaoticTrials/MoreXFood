# More XFood
This mod adds a few foods which use different ways of creating them. It's basically for learning modding because it's
the first mod I ever made. Now, it's a mod which adds random food, mainly the favorite food of my girlfriend: chicken
fricassee. Why? Because I made it as a present for her.
